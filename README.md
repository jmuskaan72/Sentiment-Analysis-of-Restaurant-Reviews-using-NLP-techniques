# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews-using-NLP-techniques
I use a restaurant review dataset to review negative or positive feedback.

The growth of web contributes a huge quantity
of user created content such as customer feedback,
opinions and reviews. Sentiment analysis in web embraces
the problem of aggregating data in the web and extraction
about opinions. Studying the opinions of customers helps
to determine the people feeling about a product and how it
is received in the market. Various commercial tools are
available for sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose
a system which classifies the reviews on a scale of 1 to 5
based on the sentiments in the words. The groups of words
used to make a decision to rate the reviews are displayed
as word cloud.
